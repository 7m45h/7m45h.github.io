        <h2>Proprietary:</h2>
        <p>
          Take Microsoft Office Word. You have to pay for it. Have to agree on 100 of pages long terms and conditions when installing. Even though you paid for it and installed in your computer, nobody knows how it programmed under the hood except Microsoft Because, its source code is not public. And that is why we call it a proprietary software. Proprietary software does not make their source code public.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that. When using proprietary software, you can not make any changes to it. You are bound to the restrictions made by their owners. Worst of all, most of these software companies collect user data in order to gain more revenue off their products. Who wants something like that? :|

        <h2>FOSS:</h2>
        <p>
          Meet <a class="anc-ext" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a> Write. You do not have to pay for it. No terms and conditions, either. Most importantly, how it is programmed, &ldquo;the source code&rdquo;. It is available to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using these programs, you are not restricted by anyone. No one is going to collect your personal data. Most of these projects are developed by communities of nice people Just like you. :D
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not stop from here, do some search on internet, gather information about the topic. I am sure you will understand why FOSS is a big deal. Finally, try to make that transition, you would not regret it.
