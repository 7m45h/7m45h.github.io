Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake.
The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.
It originated in the 1976 two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player.
The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food eaten—often apples or eggs.
The simplicity and low technical requirements of snake games have resulted in hundreds of versions—some of which have the word snake or worm in the title—for many platforms.
